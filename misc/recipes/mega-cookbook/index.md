This is a cookbook created by me and a group of friends when we moved out,
and were too lazy to cook proper meals. Every meal is for ~30 people, so that
we only had to cook about once a month. It assumes you have a 15 L pot and a
food processor. The text was [originally written in danish](./kogebog.html),
but has been translated using chatgpt.

## Spinach with Cream Sauce

### First Iteration

- 0.5 L cream
- 0.5 L oil
- 5 kg frozen spinach
- 2 kg bell peppers
- 2 whole garlic bulbs or 8-10 garlic cloves
- 30 g grated nutmeg
- 60 g salt
- 1 kg onions (about 5 large onions)
- 2 cans pea mix
- 2 cans kidney beans
- 3 packs chickpeas

Mix in other ingredients to taste. Suggestions: soybeans (for extra protein), bean sprouts, various types of bean/vegetable mixes.

Suggestion: add soybeans and include them in the recipe if you're feeling luxurious.

Chop the onions and garlic, then sauté in oil for 15 minutes. Add the spinach to the pot and let it thaw. It may be helpful to use a plastic spoon to 'mash' the spinach once it has thawed. Drain excess water if necessary. Chop the bell peppers and add the remaining ingredients to the pot. Let it cook for 30 minutes.

### Second Iteration

**Day 1:**
Soak 450g soybeans in plenty of water (preferably in the largest plastic bowl). Afterward, place them in the fridge for about an hour. Then sort out any loose shells and discolored beans. Return the bowl to the fridge until the next day.

**Day 2:**
Boil the softened soybeans in 3.5 liters of water in a large pot. Bring the water to a boil (at heat level 9) with the lid on (watch closely!), then add the beans and let it boil again without the lid. Once boiling, reduce the heat to 3 and put the lid back on.

Heat oil in a pot at heat level 7. Chop the onions and garlic, add them to the pot with salt and nutmeg, and sauté for 15 minutes. Add the spinach and thaw it over heat level 3. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for the spinach to thaw. You can mash the spinach down as it thaws. Drain excess water if necessary. Roughly chop the bell peppers and add the remaining ingredients, letting it cook for 30 minutes.

**Notes:**

- Use dried chickpeas next time. It's ideal as they can be soaked overnight alongside the soybeans. Assume 125g dried chickpeas per pack of canned chickpeas. Resource for cooking dried chickpeas: [link](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-cook-chickpeas).
- Compare the price difference between frozen peas and canned peas/carrots.
- Chopped mushrooms are cheaper than whole mushrooms (as of 2020-04-28).
- This recipe makes 13.5 liters of food, with room for an additional 0.5 liters.
