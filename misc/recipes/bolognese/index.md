**Ingredients:**

- 200 g bacon
- 250 g onions
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 dl red wine
- 2 cans chopped tomatoes
- 100 g fresh tomatoes
- 500 g beef
- 2 tbsp red balsamic vinegar

**Spices:**

- 1.5 g thyme
- 2 g pepper
- 10 g salt

Fry the bacon in olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high
heat. Remove the bacon and let it drain on a paper towel.

Add the onions, garlic, and thyme to the pot with the bacon fat and saut√©,
stirring until the onions are soft and translucent.

Add the beef and brown it, then pour in the red wine and let it reduce a
bit. Add the sundried tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and chopped tomatoes. Cut
the fried bacon into small cubes and return it to the pot.

Cover and let it simmer for about an hour over low heat. Make sure it doesn't
dry out; add a little extra red wine or vegetable broth if needed. If the
sauce is too watery, uncover and let it reduce while preparing the spaghetti.

Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Serve the pasta
in deep plates with the bolognese sauce, a drizzle of olive oil, and plenty
of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
