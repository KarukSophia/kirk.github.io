These are some recipes I use. In most daily dishes you want all of the below 4:

- Easy to make
- Healthy
- Cheap
- Tasty

I try to focus on the first three, while trying to make it decently
tasty. This is accomplished by using various frozen vegetables. Below is a
list of my recipes:

- [Bolognese](./bolognese)
- [Wok](./wok)
- [Oven Lentils](./oven-lentils)
- [Oven Rice](./oven-rice)
- [Creamed Spinach with Chickpeas and Bacon](./creamed-spinach)
- [Beige Stew](./beige-stew)

See also the [Mega Cookbook](./mega-cookbook); Some recipes me and some
friends made when we moved out from our parents, with absurdly large portions.
