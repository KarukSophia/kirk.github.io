Hi, I am Rasmus Kirk. I have a bachelors in computer science from Aarhus
University, Denmark, and I am working on getting a master degree. I have a
part-time job at the cryptocurrency firm, Concordium, as a student worker. I
like Rust and Haskell. I am also currently learning Japanese.

Here is a list of some of my software interests:

- Decentralized Technologies
- Free and Open Software
- Functional Programming
- Linux
- NixOS

Some notable projects:

- My [bachelor's project](./documents/high-assurance-cryptography-implementing-bulletproofs-in-hacspec.pdf"): High Assurance Cryptography - Implementing Bulletproofs in [Hacspec](https://github.com/hacspec/hacspec)
- [Nixarr](https://github.com/rasmus-kirk/nixarr): A Nixos module that aims to make the installation and management of running the "*Arrs" as easy as possible.
