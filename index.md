title: About me
---

Hi, I am Rasmus Kirk. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
Aarhus University, Denmark, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree
with a specialization in Cryptography and Formal Software Verification,
that I will finish January 2026. I have been working part-time as a student
worker at Concordium, a cryptocurrency firm, for about two years. I like
Rust and Haskell and I am also currently learning Japanese.

Here is a list of some of my software interests:

- Decentralized Technologies
- Cryptography
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Free and Open Software
- Functional Programming
- Linux
- NixOS

Some notable projects:

- [My bachelor's project](./documents/high-assurance-cryptography-implementing-bulletproofs-in-hacspec.pdf):
  High Assurance Cryptography - Implementing Bulletproofs in [Hacspec](https://github.com/hacspec/hacspec)
- [A Rust Toy-Blockchain](https://github.com/rasmus-kirk/p2p):
  A toy blockchain project based on the exercises from the course "Distributed
  Systems and Security" from Aarhus University.
- [Halo2 Accumulation in Rust](https://github.com/rasmus-kirk/halo-accumulation):
  A Rust implementation of the accumulation scheme used in halo2. The repo
  also contains a report explaining the background, theory and implementation
  details of the project.
- [Nixarr](https://nixarr.com):
  A Nixos module that aims to make the installation and management of a home
  media server as easy, and pain free, as possible.
- [Submerger](https://github.com/rasmus-kirk/submerger):
  Combines subtitles from two files into one, with customizable position
  and color settings.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions.
