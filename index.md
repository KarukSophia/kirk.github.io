title: About me
---

Hi, I am Rasmus Kirk. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
Aarhus University, Denmark, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree with
a specialization in Cryptography and Formal Software Verification. I have
been working part-time as a student worker at Concordium, a cryptocurrency
firm, for about two years. I like Rust and Haskell and I am also currently
learning Japanese.

Here is a list of some of my software interests:

- Decentralized Technologies
- Cryptography
- Free and Open Software
- Functional Programming
- Linux
- NixOS

Some notable projects:

- My [bachelor's 
  project](./documents/high-assurance-cryptography-implementing-bulletproofs-in-hacspec.pdf):
  High Assurance Cryptography - Implementing Bulletproofs in
  [Hacspec](https://github.com/hacspec/hacspec)
- [A toy-blockchain written in rust](https://github.com/rasmus-kirk/p2p)
- [Nixarr](https://nixarr.com): A Nixos module that aims to make the
  installation and management of a home media server as easy, and pain free,
  as possible.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
